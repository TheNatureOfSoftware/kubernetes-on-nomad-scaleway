# Kubernetes on Scaleway using `kon`

This is a sample project for setting up Kubernetes on Scaleway `ARM64` servers.

## Requirements

* You need a [Scaleway account](https://www.scaleway.com/)
* [Scaleway CLI](https://github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli)
* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)

## Setup

[`kon`](https://github.com/TheNatureOfSoftware/kubernetes-on-nomad) has a [Scaleway example](https://github.com/TheNatureOfSoftware/kubernetes-on-nomad/tree/master/examples/scaleway) you can take a look at, it works the same way but uses `X86_64`
